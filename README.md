Hello, my name is Abdul Rehman, and I'm a young teen aiming to accomplish my goals by pursuing my hobbies.
My passion is writing code, learning new things, and building unique and interesting projects. 
I've been learning front-end web dev for a year and I'm now focusing on improving my skills further.
I am eager to contribute to projects that align with my interests and broaden my expertise.
